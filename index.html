                    <p>I completed my Matric in Science at Montesssori Grammer High School, Rahim Yar Khan 64200.
                        I served as Chief Boy and subsequently Head Boy at my school for four years, where I learned
                        many managerial skills.

                    <p>I began my pre-engineering journey at Superior Group of Colleges and became SVL (student voice
                        leader) of my section in the first month. At the end of my degree, I received the Best SVL
                        Certificate from 2019 to 2021, which helped me enhance my leadership skills. </p>

                    <p>When I arrived at campus, I noticed a significant difference in the environment. As an introvert,
                        studying in public was tough for me. However, I overcame my fear of people and participated in
                        five project exhibitions (including ESPICE and Science Mela) to present my projects and
                        communication skills. Participating in these types of events improved my communication and
                        presentation skills and helped me maintain a CGPA of 3.6 or above with practical knowledge and
                        management skills.Furthermore, I'm about to start my final year.</p>

                    <p>In August 2023, I was offered an internship at the ICR IT Center (Project by Hello World) in
                        React-native App Development. I got hands-on experience with React Native and learned about
                        Github, Figma, Javascript, Rest APIs, and Firebase. That three-month internship helped me a lot
                        in learning about app development and becoming familiar with the most popular React framework.I
                        got A grade Certificate In React-Native.
